# NJ COVID-19 & NLTK Visualization

This was a quick project I did for my class in Data Visualization at Stockton University.
I used the COVID Tracking API to get the URL for New Jersey's COVID-19 website and scrape its contents.
Then, I converted the site to plain text and fed it to the Natural Language Toolkit to perform NLP.
The resulting visualization shows the frequency distribution of the 25 most common words on the New Jersey Department of Health's website.
